## Balloon Numerator ##
Year 2 university group coursework (PPM) - a Balloon Fight inspired educational game proof of concept.

Repo open-sourced in the hopes I may return to it one day and make an actual game of it, or that something in this mess is useful to somebody.

# Requirements ##
Any non-ancient C++ compiler (was tested with MSVC 2010 and GCC 4.8.0)
Libraries: SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_ttf.

# Level/Enemy Modding #
Check the README in the levels folder.

# History/Known Issues #
Coding portion was eventually done entirely as a rushed one-man effort while suffering health issues. Code quality reflects that.
Was mostly tested/built on Windows in an old version of VS, with some Linux builds at various intervals.
Cannot guarantee the included makefile works.
